The Tech Job market has been affected by massive layoffs and since 2021 there have been more than 600,000.00 tech layoffs.

Good news is that the Fed Reserve has cut interest rates which should boost tech hiring however tech companies will still only hire the best candidates and would not over hire. Also there are a large number of laid off techies who would want to get hired first. To ensure candidates get hired they need to be better than the other Jobseekers.

The Job market is Hyper Competitive. For 1 position 500-1000 candidates or more are applying and laid off job seekers are also competing for entry level Job positions.

But unlike software (with observability platforms such as AppDynamics and Datadog), construction teams lack automated feedback loops to help projects stay on schedule and on budget. Without this observability, construction wastes a whopping $3T per year because glitches aren’t detected fast enough to recover.
   

  

 Doxel AI exists to bring computer vision to construction, so the industry can deliver what society needs to thrive. From hospitals to data centers, from foreman to VPs of construction, teams use Doxel to make better decisions everyday. In fact, Doxel has contributed to the construction of the facilities that provide many of the products and services you use everyday.
   

  

 We have classic computer vision, deep learning ML object detection, a low\\-latency 3D three.js web app, a complex data pipeline powering it all in the background. We’re building out new workflows, analytics dashboards, and forecasting engines.
   

  

 We’re at an exciting stage of scale as we build upon our growing market momentum. Our software is trusted by Shell Oil, Genentech, HCA healthcare, Kaiser, Turner, Layton and several others. Join us in bringing AI to construction!
   

  

**Role**
 The role of a Backend Engineer has evolved. With the rise of local\\-first applications and WebAssembly (Wasm), the boundary between backend and frontend has blurred. Traditional data processing and analytics, once confined to server infrastructure, have now extended into the browser analytically with DuckDb, and visually with Three.js. This shift enables powerful, low\\-latency computation directly on the client, transforming how we architect and optimize systems.
   

  

 Our backend team produces the foundation for Doxel's construction insights. You'll own the technology that brings insights through processing vast amounts of project data daily, by capturing and analyzing hundreds of thousands of square feet of 360 video. You will collaborate closely with Product, Frontend Engineering, and Design to build intuitive, high\\-performance solutions that empower our customers. Additionally, you'll partner with internal teams developing and refining our state\\-of\\-the\\-art LLM, Computer Vision (CV), and Machine Learning (ML) automation pipelines.
   

  

 As Doxel scales to serve more customers, we need to fortify our data pipeline and API infrastructure to improve reliability, reduce service disruptions, and enhance extensibility for new features. You will bring backend software development expertise to establish strong design patterns, unify our data pipeline, and ensure seamless interaction across teams and systems. You are eager to learn beyond your immediate expertise and capable of mentoring others in your domain. Above all, you prioritize building reliable, low\\-maintenance software that supports both traditional backend processing and emerging in\\-browser computational paradigms.
   

  

**Who You Are**
 You are a relentless problem\\-solver who takes deep ownership of your work, ensuring every line of code is correct, reliable, and built for complex, real\\-world domains. You anticipate failure points, eliminate edge case bugs, and engineer systems that handle ambiguity with precision. You don’t just write software—you make it rock solid. You thrive in rich domain environments where correctness matters as much as performance. You seek feedback, iterate quickly, and push yourself to improve. You take initiative, tackle the hardest problems head\\-on, and refuse to settle for anything less than technical excellence and real impact.
   

  

**What You’ll Do**
* Design, develop, and maintain APIs that power our Three.js and DuckDb powered frontend applications
* Extend and optimize our idempotent data pipelines using Airflow to adapt to evolving business needs
* Develop and manage our data storage and processing stack, leveraging DuckDB for analytical workloads and PostgreSQL for transactional data
* Implement and maintain robust data processing workflows that ingest and structure data from 360\\-degree video, project management schedules, and IoT sensors
* Explore and integrate WebAssembly\\-powered local computation where appropriate to enable flexibility, performance, and reduce server round trip time
* Develop diagnostic tools to monitor data quality and pipeline performance
* Strike a balance between rapid iteration and long\\-term software stability
* Identify and manage complexity in workflows by implementing general, flexible, and scalable data processing paradigms
* Work with CV and ML engineers to deploy cutting\\-edge 3D computer vision models


**What You’ll Bring To The Team**
* 3\\+ years of experience in Python, C\\+\\+, Typescript, or a functional programming language
* 2\\+ years of experience in backend or full\\-stack engineering within an agile, cloud\\-based environment
* 1\\+ year of experience working with ETL pipelines and workflow orchestration tools like Airflow
* Experience with Kubernetes and cloud infrastructure
* Strong SQL expertise with deep knowledge of query optimization and table structures, including experience with PostgreSQL
* Experience with WebAssembly (Wasm) and its applications in local\\-first data processing is a plus
* Experience with test\\-driven development and automated testing strategies
* Exposure to CV or ML development is a plus but not required
* Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or a related technical field

* 🏅 A quality obsessive. Someone who deeply cares about our users and the quality of their work. Our customers are not tech companies. They’re people who live and work in the real world.

* 🤝 A team player. You love giving and receiving feedback, and learning and growing as a team.
* 📈 Unafraid of failure. You take risks. You see failure as an opportunity to learn, grow, and be better the next time. In a weird way, you trick your brain into being excited when you fail, because it means you got a new opportunity to learn more.

* Have empathy for our users and build solutions for them. And you’ll be able to do this without any explicit planning or expectations.
* Push for a high bar for the quality of our codebase and our technical decisions. You’ll help in setting the standard for the future as we scale the engineering organization here at Rillavoice.
* Scale yourself. Being an early\\-stage company, you will need to grow individually as the company scales.
* Help recruit future engineers to expand the team.


**What You Bring**
* 2\\+ years experience in building software, ideally some of it in startups.
* Ability to move fast and iterate quickly without sacrificing quality.
* A customer\\-first mindset and an interest in talking with customers to make sure what we’re building meets their needs.
* Bonus if you have experience in React, React Native, Typescript and Python

But unlike software (with observability platforms such as AppDynamics and Datadog), construction teams lack automated feedback loops to help projects stay on schedule and on budget. Without this observability, construction wastes a whopping $3T per year because glitches aren’t detected fast enough to recover.
   

  

 Doxel AI exists to bring computer vision to construction, so the industry can deliver what society needs to thrive. From hospitals to data centers, from foreman to VPs of construction, teams use Doxel to make better decisions everyday. In fact, Doxel has contributed to the construction of the facilities that provide many of the products and services you use everyday.
   

  

 We have LLM\\-driven automation, classic computer vision, deep learning ML object detection, a low\\-latency 3D three.js web app, and a complex data pipeline powering it all in the background. We’re building out new workflows, analytics dashboards, and forecasting engines. Join us in bringing AI to construction!
   

  

 We're at an exciting stage of scale as we build upon our growing market momentum. Our software is trusted by Shell Oil, Genentech, HCA healthcare, Kaiser, Turner, Layton and several others. Join us in bringing AI to construction!
   

  

**The Role**
 The role of a Frontend Engineer has evolved. With the rise of local\\-first applications and WebAssembly (Wasm), the boundary between backend and frontend has blurred. Traditional data processing and analytics, once confined to server infrastructure, have now extended into the browser analytically with DuckDb, and visually with Three.js. This shift enables powerful, low\\-latency computation directly on the client, transforming how we architect and optimize systems.
   

  

 Our frontend team is responsible for creating high\\-performance, interactive experiences that empower construction teams to make real\\-time decisions. You will work on architecting and implementing complex UI components, optimizing rendering performance, and seamlessly integrating our frontend applications with data from a client\\-side DuckDb database, backend APIs, and real\\-time data pipelines. You’ll push the boundaries of what’s possible with modern web technologies, working closely with designers, backend engineers, and data scientists to craft intuitive, scalable, and visually compelling applications.
   

  

 As Doxel scales, we need to build interfaces that not only handle massive datasets but also deliver a seamless, highly responsive user experience. You will play a critical role in optimizing the UI for performance, ensuring robust state management, and enabling users to visualize and collaborate with Three.js scenes, analytics dashboards, and AI\\-driven insights. You take pride in deeply understanding user workflows, anticipate their needs, and design interfaces that are both powerful and easy to use.
   

  

**Who You Are**
 You are a problem\\-solver who thrives on tackling complex challenges with precision and pragmatism. You take ownership of your work, ensuring every solution is correct, maintainable, and crafted with a deep understanding of user experience. You care about intuitive design, seamless interactions, and building interfaces that feel effortless. You anticipate edge cases, refine your craft relentlessly, and stay curious, always pushing yourself to improve. You seek feedback, collaborate effectively, and take pride in delivering mission\\-critical software that is technically sound, visually polished, and deeply impactful.
   

  

**What You’ll Do**
* Build high\\-performance construction analytics tools with Vue.js and Three.js, enabling users to visualize and interact with complex 3D models and real\\-time data
* Ensure seamless API integration with backend services for real\\-time data streaming and efficient processing of construction insights
* Improve rendering performance and UI responsiveness to handle complex geospatial data and AI\\-driven predictions
* Demand a high bar for code quality, test coverage, and usability to ensure stability and reliability
* Work closely with product managers and industry professionals to translate construction workflows into seamless user experiences
* Continuously refine and enhance user interfaces based on customer feedback and evolving business needs


**What You’ll Bring To The Team**
* 2\\+ years of frontend development experience in complex, fast\\-paced software environments, tackling large\\-scale data visualization and real\\-time analytics challenges
* Proficiency in modern frontend frameworks like Vue.js, React, or Angular
* Experience with Next.js or Nuxt.js for server\\-side rendering and optimized frontend performance
* Strong knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and best practices for web development, with a deep understanding of CS fundamentals, data structures, and problem\\-solving techniques
* Strong communication skills to collaborate with cross\\-functional teams and translate requirements into seamless user experiences
* Experience with WebGL frameworks like Three.js or Babylon.js is a plus
* Familiarity with Wasm or backend development (Rust, C\\+\\+, Python, SQL) is a plus
* Comfortable working with data visualization tools such as Tableau, Looker, or Metabase
* Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or a related technical field


 The base pay range for this position is $150,000 \\- $180,000\\. Pay is based on factors such as location, skill level, qualifications, competencies, and overall experience. Options may be included as an additional part of the package.

 As a Full Stack Developer, you have a keen grasp of the full application lifecycle, from breaking down requirements to writing testable code for the front\\-end and the back\\-end, to documenting the details so it’s easy to make updates in the future. You are great at drawing the line between what happens on the front\\-end and what happens on the back\\-end to take advantage of the best aspects of each. You can juggle performance, ease\\-of\\-implementation and ease\\-of\\-change because you have visibility of and vision for the full\\-stack.
   

  

**About Us**
 We’re a small company of overachieving consultants, taking on big challenges for our clients. We build web applications, mobile applications and application solutions for a wide range of clients, with a focus on the public sector. We use a team\\-based approach, with teams consisting of designers, software developers, quality assurance engineers and project managers. This allows us to provide the full lifecycle of project delivery to clients from initial concept consulting to final implementation.
   

  

**About You**
 You can analyse a set of business requirements, break them down into technical features and tasks and visualize how the different aspects of the system will come together through data structures, APIs and persisted entities. You are as comfortable crafting a UI and creating the necessary APIs and server\\-side functionality to drive it as you are analyzing a set of external APIs and figuring out what kind of API patterns it will best support.
   

  

 You know enough about all aspects of application development to make good decisions about architecture choices to allow team members who are more expert in each area apply their expertise efficiently. You might not be a UX expert but you are aware of good javascript patterns, libraries and UI Kits to get things going from a visual perspective. You might not be a database expert but you can define entity relationships that will make the necessary lookups performant. You might not be an API expert but you know how to design REST interfaces and GraphQL schemas that will securely expose the right levels of detail needed by each type of user of the system.
   

  

 You understand techniquest for accessibility, performance, unit and integration testing, internationalization, software design patterns, refactoring techniques, and branching strategies. You know the tools for creating modern web applications and cross\\-platform mobile applications. Our current preferred stack is Java with Spring Boot on the back\\-end and React and React Native for front\\-end. We also like GraphQL, NextJS, JPA, Liquibase, Tailwind, Ant Design and Material UI Kits, Typescript, Gradle, Sass, AWS and Docker. But we’re perpetually monitoring and exploring the technology landscape and have been known to dabble with PWA, Machine Learning, NoSQL and JamStack solutions on occasion. A deep curiosity and openness to new technologies and techniques is the only thing we tend not to change up.
   

  

 You love taking (sometimes ambiguous!) client requirements and translating them into best\\-practice patterns. You can help less experienced developers find the right ways of doing things, and you are just as happy churning out deliverables yourself. You have great communication skills, good attention to detail and a strong sense of high\\-quality product.
   

  

**High\\-quality To You Means**
* well aligned to internal designs and to the client’s vision
* a clean and reliable user experience
* high levels of accessibility
* consistency both within the current project and with industry best practices
* highly testable and tested
* reusable to enable increased efficiency in the future
* maintainable both from a development perspective, and also from a client perspective


 Our projects are centered around our teams. We do more than speak the Agile lingo, we strive for a truly agile culture. A background of working with Scrum or Kanban is a plus but what’s really most important is having experience and willingness to work in a highly collaborative team setting. An important part of our team focus involves being able to coordinate work with the rest of the team. A valuable skill is being able to identify large blocks of functionality from requirements and design artifacts and break them down into suitable features and tasks.
   

  

 As much as you have an eye for detail, you have an eye on the future. Application development is constantly evolving so we’re looking for someone to bring some new skills and capabilities to our existing teams. Whether you have an opinion on some of the emerging light\\-weight headless CMSs or have A/B testing experience to bring a more data driven approach to decision making we value the unique perspectives you can bring to our existing teams.
   

  

 Our Why
   

  

 We strive for excellence in everything we do. We value wisdom, curiosity, and a sense of fun.
   

  

 Our work is meaningful. From providing easier and better ways for citizens to access state government information and programs aiding in a more informed and better served populace, to keeping pets and animals safe through registration and welfare tracking, to making vaccines available to people most in need\\- our software often has a direct benefit to people we’ll never meet.
   

  

 We are also very dedicated to the people within our organization. We are proud to be consistently named one of Maine’s ""Best Places to Work"".
   

  

**The Benefits That We Offer Include**
* 100% Paid health and dental benefits for employees
* Health Reimbursement Account (to minimize out of pocket costs)
* Flexible Spending and Dependent Care Accounts
* Company matching retirement plan
* Annual profit sharing
* Flexible scheduling
* Up to 25 days paid vacation
* Free parking (you will love Old Port parking)
* Friday happy hours

 Hightouch’s mission is to empower everyone to take action on their data. We’ve pioneered the Composable Customer Data Platform (CDP), which helps companies use their own data warehouse to collect, prepare, and activate customer data for marketing personalization and business operations. Traditionally, acting on data has required engineering time and bandwidth, and left most business users stuck with charts and reports that are unable to take automated action on their data. With Hightouch, every business user, without writing any code, can activate data to streamline critical processes, improve marketing performance, and scale operations.
   

  

 Our team operates with a focus on making a meaningful impact for our customers. We believe in approaching challenges with a first\\-principles thinking mindset, moving quickly and embracing our value of efficient execution, and treating each other with compassion and kindness. We look for team members who are strong communicators, have a growth mindset, and are motivated and persistent in achieving our goals.
   

  

 Hundreds of companies use Hightouch, including PetSmart, Warner Music Group, Spotify, Ramp, Retool, Plaid, and L’Oreal. We’re based in San Francisco and are remote\\-friendly. Hightouch is backed by leading investors such as Amplify Partners, ICONIQ Growth, Bain Capital Ventures, Y\\-Combinator, and Afore Capital.
   

  

**About The Role**
 We are looking for a
 **distributed systems engineer** 
 to work on the systems that power the syncing engine our customers and other engineering teams rely on. This presents an exciting challenge where you can apply your expertise in distributed systems, performance optimization, and troubleshooting to push the boundaries of what is possible and meaningfully improve our ability to move massive amounts of customer data. This role also provides a unique opportunity to work on a multi\\-cloud and multi\\-region infrastructure that supports a global customer base.
   

  

 We believe in enabling our engineers to do their best work for our customers by giving them extremely high levels of ownership and autonomy. This comes in different forms: you will own and deliver projects from start to finish, you will work directly with customers to solve their hardest scaling problems, and you will have a lot of influence over what we work on as a team and company.
   

  

 Some of the problems we’ll be working on include:
   

  

- Sync Speed: Customers want to sync a lot of data to important destinations like Facebook and Snapchat, which requires us to analyze every part of our syncing process and find where we can optimize to sync data more quickly

- Streaming Syncing: We currently sync data from sources in batch only, but envision a world where we also do syncs in real\\-time and support streaming sources like webhooks and queues

- Scalability and Reliability: As part of our rapid growth, we’re always evaluating current future bottlenecks in scaling and reliability, and architecting for the next order of magnitude of growth

 Personalization API: Our Personalization API product provides a low latency caching layer on top of data warehouses that enable customers to use their data warehouse for real\\-time personalization use cases with
 - Multi\\-Region and Multi\\-Cloud: Supporting our multi\\-region and multi\\-cloud backend, including extending it to launch Hightouch on in new regions to support data residency requirements of our global customer base

 We are looking for talented, intellectually curious, and motivated individuals who are interested in tackling the problems above. This is a senior role, but we focus on impact and potential for growth more than years of experience. The salary range for this position is $180,000 \\- $260,000 USD per year, which is location independent in accordance with our remote\\-first policy. We also offer meaningful equity compensation in the form of ISO options, and offer early exercise and a 10 year post\\-termination exercise window.
   

  

**About You**
 You are an engineer with a passion for solving hard technical problems that generate real value for customers. You’re motivated by high ownership and are comfortable in a fast\\-paced, startup environment.
   

  

 You have experience and comfort with distributed systems and high\\-scale systems or the ability and desire to build this experience quickly. This experience can take different forms:
   

  

* You’ve built syncing engines that process and move terabytes of data per day in a scalable way
* You’ve created event collection or data streaming services that power company critical systems
* You’ve owned systems that have undergone orders of magnitude of growth and helped them scale accordingly
* You have relevant skills and are a fast learner who is excited to take on the challenges we face


 Interview Process
   

  

 Our goal with the interview process is to balance speed with giving both parties opportunities to assess whether there is a strong mutual fit. We will ask you questions, but we want you to ask us questions! Our technical interviews focus on how you design systems because we believe this is the best way for us to see how you work and for you to see how we collaborate. We don’t ask you to write code to solve technical brainteasers that don’t appear in your day to day job.
   

  

* Recruiter Screen \\[30m]: Introductory call with our recruiting team to get to know each other and see if the role could be a good mutual fit.
* System Design Screen \\[45m]: Designing a data processing feature end\\-to\\-end.
* Hiring Manager Interview \\[30m]: Chat with hiring manager about past experiences and future operating preferences to assess fit on company values and operating principles.
* System Design Interview \\[90m]: Work with the interviewer to architect a system at a conceptual level.

 OXMAN is a hybrid Design and R\\&D company that fuses design, technology, and biology to invent multi\\-scale products and environments. The fusion of disciplines within our work opens previously impossible opportunities within each domain—allowing design to inspire science and science to inspire design.
   

  

 At OXMAN, we question dominant modes of design that have divorced us from Nature by prioritizing humanity above all else (human\\-centric design). Although it is design that has caused this rift, we believe that design also offers the greatest opportunity to heal it.
   

  

 We propose a Nature\\-centric approach that delivers design solutions by, for, and with the natural world, while advancing humanity. In this pursuit, we reject all forms of segregation and instead call for a radical synergy between human\\-made and Nature\\-grown environments.
   

  

 This approach demands that we design across scales for systems\\-level impact. We consider every designed construct a whole system of heterogeneous and complex interrelations—not isolated objects—that are intrinsically connected to their environments. In doing so, we open ourselves up to moving beyond mere maintenance toward the advancement of Nature.
   

  

**Summary**
 OXMAN is seeking a Computational Design Engineer/ Computer Scientist to join an all\\-star interdisciplinary team of deep thinkers and brilliant makers, leveraging math and computation as a language for mediation between human\\-made and Nature\\-grown environments. This person embodies both technical and aesthetic rigor in developing and applying computational methods toward the realization of novel design paradigms by building design tools for new methods of manufacturing as well as application software that interfaces with industrial and custom digital fabrication tools. In this role, they will conduct research in computational geometry, computational fabrication, computational intelligence, and/or computational dynamics and apply this research to design. They will develop striking embodiments, processes, and strategies to engage with complex environments and behavior spaces, not only through representation and prediction but also through optimization, exploration, and learning. Taking a generative and generalizable approach to design and process\\-driven making, the Computational Design Engineer will contribute to a range of projects at OXMAN, spanning client\\-specific design work and platform technology development. This way of thinking and making enables them to facilitate mediation and dialog, opening opportunities for non\\-obvious interactions and combined systems that unite physical, digital, and biological elements.

* Research: Conduct research to enable and support projects through computational design technologies. Research is integrated to specific projects or facilitates the development of computational design processes used across projects
* Implementation: Realize design concepts by using computational methods to design embodiments and, further, implement novel computational design processes that generate embodiments (e.g., 3D models, fabrication descriptions, machine interfaces, software, scripts)
* Visualization: Develop 3D renderings and illustrations to inform and express research and design concepts to the team, clients, and the public
* Collaborate with a multidisciplinary team of engineers, biologists, and designers
* Communicate ideas, work, and progress clearly, including by engaging in team meetings, presentations, and other creative communication outlets
